MM-Hide-All
===
[MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/v2-beta) Module to hide everything on screen.

Setup:
---
* Add the following to your config:
````javascript
{
	module: 'mm-hide-all',
	position: 'bottom_right'
},
````

Once the module is loaded correctly, simple click or tap the 'Hide' button. Click it again to get everything back.

* Note

This requires the ability for you to click the buttons. It is not voice activated nor does it play automatically.

I built this as I am personally working on a touch screen MagicMirror of my own that I plan to use this on.
